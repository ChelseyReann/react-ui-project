# NY Times Best Selling Books List 📚

## Introduction
Using an [API](https://github.com/ChelseyReann/book-api) that I created, I designed website for the NY Times Best Seller Book List from the week of April 5th, 2023. I incorporated a UI Design element, the hamburger menu! The website is fairly bare bones at the moment. I really wanted to make sure I understood how the hamburger menu would be implemented in React.js. This is my first project using React.js. I only hope to grow from here.
