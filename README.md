# NY Times Best Selling Books List 📚

## Introduction
Using an API that I created, I designed website for the NY Times Best Seller Book List from the week of April 5th, 2023. I incorporated a UI Design element, the hamburger menu! The website is fairly bare bones at the moment. I really wanted to make sure I understood how the hamburger menu would be implemented in React.js. This is my first project using React.js. I only hope to grow from here.

To learn more about my API, check out the link to that repo [here](https://github.com/ChelseyReann/book-api).

## Installation
1. Fork and clone this repository.
2. Install the dependencies using the below command.
```
npm i
```
3. Once the dependecies are downloaded you can check out the site on your local server by running the below command.
```
npm run start
```
4. Happy coding!

## How To View My Deployed Site
The app is deployed on Netlify and you can check it out by clicking this [link](https://nyt-bestseller-book-list.netlify.app/).

## Future Plans
Some things that would change about this project if I was starting over:
- Implement another UI design, ie. slider, so you don't have go back to the hamburger menu to look at all the books
- Utilize a search bar so user's could look up by book title or author
- I wanted to showcase my back-end skills by using the API that I had deployed on [Heroku](https://nytimes-book-api.herokuapp.com/books). (If you would like to read more about that project, click [here](https://github.com/ChelseyReann/book-api).) However, if I was doing this again, I would use the NYT Books API to have an updated list of the best seller list.
